# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

## Setup

### Prerequisites

This project depends on:

  - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
  - [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### asdf

This project uses `asdf`. Use the following to install the required tools:

```sh
# The first time
brew install asdf # Mac-specific
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf plugin add yarn
asdf plugin add postgres

# To install (or update, following a change to .tool-versions)
asdf install
```

When installing the `pg` gem, bundle changes directory outside of this
project directory, causing it lose track of which version of postgres has
been selected in the project's `.tool-versions` file. To ensure the `pg` gem
installs correctly, you'll want to set the version of postgres that `asdf`
will use:

```sh
# Temporarily set the version of postgres to use to build the pg gem
ASDF_POSTGRES_VERSION=13.5 bundle install
```

### Linting

To run the linters:

```bash
bin/lint
```
### Intellisense

[solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) is bundled as part of the
development dependencies. You need to [set it up for your
editor](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph#using-solargraph), and then run
this command to index your local bundle (re-run if/when we install new
dependencies and you want completion):

```sh
bin/bundle exec yard gems
```

You'll also need to configure your editor's `solargraph` plugin to
`useBundler`:

```diff
+  "solargraph.useBundler": true,
```
## How the application works

We keep track of architecture decisions in [Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs)](/adr/).

We use `rladr` to generate the boilerplate for new records:

```bash
bin/bundle exec rladr new title
```
