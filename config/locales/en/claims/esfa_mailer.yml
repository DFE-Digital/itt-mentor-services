        subject: Claims requiring clawback - Claim funding for mentor training
        body: |
          To the payer,
    
          The claims in the CSV file link are ready for clawback— the link to the latest CSV file is valid for 7 days:
            
          %{url_for_csv}
          
          What you need to do:
            
          1. Check and validate the claims in the CSV file by marking them as ‘clawback_in_progress’ or ‘clawback_complete’ in the ‘claim_status’ column.
            
          2. If you mark a claim as ‘clawback_in_progress’, add the reason to the ‘clawback_unsuccessful_reason’ column.
            
          3. Reply to this email and attach the updated CSV file.
          
          The Claim Support team will follow up on the reasons for the claims that you could not claw back and email you an updated version.
          
          If you have a problem opening the link or it has expired, reply to this email and request that it be sent again.
