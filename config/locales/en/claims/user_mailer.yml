        subject: Your funding for mentor training will be taken back
        body: |
          Dear %{user_name},

          A claim you made was audited and there was insufficient proof from you that some or all of the claim was valid. Your funding for mentor training will be taken from you and returned to the Department for Education.

          Retrieving this funding is known as clawback.

          Amount being clawed back: %{clawback_amount}
          Claim reference: %{claim_reference}
          
          # What happens next
          The funds will automatically be taken from you.
          
          For academies, any recovery will be offset in your next available monthly payment. For maintained schools, any recovery will be offset in your local authorityâ€™s next available monthly payment and they will recover funding from you via their usual processes.
