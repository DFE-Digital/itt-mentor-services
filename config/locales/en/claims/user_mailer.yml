          Dear %{user_name},
          
          You have been invited to join the %{service_name} service for %{organisation_name} because you are a [DfE-sign approver](%{sign_in_approver_url}) for your organisation.

          If you are not the right person in your organisation to submit funding claims for initial teacher training (ITT) general mentor training, please:

          - access the service using DfE sign-in and add an appropriate colleague in the Users section
          - forward this email to the appropriate colleague after adding them as a user
          
          # Claim funding for mentor training service
          
          This new DfE service enables schools and education organisations to claim funding for the time spent becoming an ITT general mentor.
          
          Your organisation has been added to the service because an accredited ITT provider has informed DfE that one or more trainee teachers have undertaken a school placement there during academic year %{academic_year_name}.

          # Sign in to submit claims
          
          Sign in using DfE sign-in:
          
          [%{sign_in_url}](%{sign_in_url})
          
          If your colleague needs to create a DfE Sign-in account, they can do this after clicking "Sign in using DfE Sign-in"
          
          After creating a DfE Sign-in account, they will need to return to this email and [sign in to access the service](%{sign_in_url})

          # Prior to submitting claims

          We recommend confirming with your accredited ITT provider the number of hours you are claiming, as they may be asked to provide evidence to support this claim.

          Dear %{user_name},

          A claim you made was audited and there was insufficient proof from you that some or all of the claim was valid. Your funding for mentor training will be taken from you and returned to the Department for Education.

          Retrieving this funding is known as clawback.

          The funds will automatically be taken from you.
          
          For academies, any recovery will be offset in your next available monthly payment. For maintained schools, any recovery will be offset in your local authority’s next available monthly payment and they will recover funding from you via their usual processes.

          The Claim Funding for ITT Mentoring Training digital service launched in April 2025.
          
          We believe your school is eligible to claim funding for the time your Initial Teacher Training (ITT) mentors spent in training this academic year.
          
          If your school has been added to the Register trainee teacher service by your accredited provider, you should have been onboarded and are eligible to claim. However, we’ve not yet received a claim from you.

          Check if you’ve received an onboarding email from DfE.
          
          If not, ask your school’s DfE Sign-in approver if they’ve received it and can add users.
          
          If no one has received it, confirm with your accredited provider that your school is on the Register trainee teacher service.
