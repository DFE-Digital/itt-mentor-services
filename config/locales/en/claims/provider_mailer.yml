        subject: ITT mentor claims need to be quality assured
        body: |
          %{provider_name},

          You are required by Department for Education (DfE) to complete quality assurance on funding claims associated with %{provider_name}.

          One or more schools submitted funding requests to DfE due to you providing training for their staff to become initial teacher training (ITT) mentors.

          # You must complete quality assurance by %{completion_date}

          If you do not check these claims by 11:59pm on %{completion_date}, we may escalate the assurance process. This can include removing funding from schools you worked with.

          ------------

          # What you need to do

          Use the CSV file to check the accuracy of the claims associated with you and record your answers in the file. It is in a spreadsheet format for you to fill out.

          Visit the GOV.UK claim funding for mentor training website to download the file:

          [%{download_csv_url}](%{download_csv_url})

          This link will expire in 7 days due to data security. To request a new link, reply to this email.

          To complete the CSV, you must:

            - fill in ‘yes’ or no’ in the ‘claim_accepted’ column
            - for any ‘no’ answers, give us a reason for rejection validated by the school in the ‘rejection_reason’ column
            - reply to this email and attach the updated file by %{completion_date}

          ## If the claims are accurate
          If the mentors, hours and number of claims are correct, mark the claims as ‘yes’ in the ‘claim_accepted’ column of the CSV file.

          ## If you disagree with a claim
          If you disagree with the information a school submitted to us, contact the school to discuss it. They may have additional evidence or a reason.

          ## If the school gives you valid evidence after speaking to them
          If you accept the evidence the placement school provides, mark the claim as ‘yes’ in the ‘claim_accepted’ column.

          ## If the school does not give you valid evidence after speaking to them
          If the school cannot provide any additional information or cannot provide information that you accept, mark the claim as ‘no’ in the ‘claim_accepted’ column.

          You must give a reason why a claim is incorrect. Write this in the ‘rejection_reason’ column.

          Some reasons may include that a mentor is:

            - on the Early Career Framework (ECF), rather than ITT
            - claiming too many hours
            - claiming too few hours
            - not known to you
            - not employed at the school

          --------

          ## After you complete quality assurance

          For any rejected claims, we will contact schools to confirm they agree. Make sure you speak to the school about rejected claims before you submit your answers to us. This will avoid any confusion about their eligibility for funding.
