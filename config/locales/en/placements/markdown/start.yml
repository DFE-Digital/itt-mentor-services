        This service is for schools offering placements for trainee teachers and 
        Initial teacher training (ITT) providers in England 
        (accredited ITT providers and lead partners).

        If you are a school, use this service to record ITT placements at your organisation.

        If you are an ITT provider, use this service to find ITT school placement opportunities.

        If you are a school, you will be asked for:

        - your mentors' Teacher reference number (TRN)
        - your mentors' date of birth
