<%= @school_name %> has deleted <%= @provider_name %> from the list of providers they work with.

##What happens next?
<% if @placements.present? %>
You will remain assigned to current placements for this academic year unless the school removes you. <%= @placements.many? ? "These placements are" : "This placement is" %>:

<% @placements.each do |placement| %>
- [<%= placement[:title] %>](<%= placement[:url] %>)
<% end %>

We recommend you speak to the school to check whether they expect you to fill <%= @placements.many? ? "these placements" : "this placement" %>. Contact them on [<%= @itt_contact_email %>](mailto:<%= @itt_contact_email %>).

<% else %>
You will no longer be assigned placements by this school unless they add you again or you add them to your list of schools.

If you think this is a mistake, contact them on [<%= @itt_contact_email %>](mailto:<%= @itt_contact_email %>).
