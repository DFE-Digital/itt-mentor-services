Dear <%= @user_name %>,

You now have access to the <%= @service_name %> service for <%= @organisation_name %>.

Please sign-in this week to record your school's preferences for offering placements for trainee teachers.

It is important to do this so teacher training providers know whether to contact you, and to ensure you do not miss out on getting trainee teachers in your school.

[Sign in to Manage school placements](<%= @sign_in_url %>)

If you do not have DfE Sign-in, create an account. You can then return to this email to access the service.

If you need help or have feedback for us, contact [<%= @support_email %>](mailto:<%= @support_email %>).

Thank you.

<%= @service_name %> service
