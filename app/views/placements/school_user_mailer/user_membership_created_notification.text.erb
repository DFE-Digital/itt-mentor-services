Dear <%= @user_name %>,

You now have access to the <%= @service_name %> service for <%= @organisation_name %>.

Please sign-in this week to record your school's preferences for offering placements for trainee teachers.

If you are not the right person to do this, please:

- access the service using DfE sign-in and add an appropriate colleague in the Users section (you can do this because you are a DfE sign-in approver for your school)
- forward this email to the appropriate colleague after adding them as a user.

It is important to do this so teacher training providers know whether to contact your school, and to ensure your school does not miss out on getting trainee teachers.

## Sign in to record preferences

[Use DfE sign-in to access the Manage school placements service](<%= @sign_in_url %>)

If your colleague does not have DfE sign-in, they can [create an account](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/).

After creating a DfE sign-in account, they will need to return to this email to access the service.

## Give feedback or report a problem

If you need help or have feedback for us, contact [<%= @support_email %>](mailto:<%= @support_email %>).

Thank you.

<%= @service_name %> service
