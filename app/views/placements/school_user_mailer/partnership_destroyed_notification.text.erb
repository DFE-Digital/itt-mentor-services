<%= @provider_name %> has deleted <%= @school_name %> from the list of schools they work with.

## What happens next?
<% if @placements.present? %>
They will remain assigned to current placements unless you remove them. These placements are:

<% @placements.each do |placement| %>
- [<%= placement[:title] %>](<%= placement[:url] %>)
<% end %>

We recommend you speak to the provider to avoid confusion about placing trainees at your school. Contact them on [<%= @provider_email_address %>](mailto:<%= @provider_email_address %>).
<% else %>
You will no longer be able to assign placements to this provider unless they add you again or you add them to your list of providers.

If you think this is a mistake, contact them on [<%= @provider_email_address %>](mailto:<%= @provider_email_address %>).
