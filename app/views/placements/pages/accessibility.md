# Accessibility statement for Manage school placements

This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:

-   change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
-   zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
-   navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
-   listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Becoming a Teacher team (DfE) is committed to making Manage school placements accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

The service was designed using the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), which conforms to the WCAG 2.2 AA standard. To ensure the service fully meets the WCAG 2.2 AA standard, we are currently arranging an accessibility audit. We will update this page following the audit, and publish details of any accessibility issues identified.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We are working alongside other government departments and agencies to fix content which fails to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.
