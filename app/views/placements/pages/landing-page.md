Use this service if you are involved in arranging school placements for trainee teachers in England.

This service is currently running as a pilot in Leeds and Essex.

### If you work in a school
Record your preferences for offering placements for trainee teachers.

Depending on your situation, you can let teacher training providers know:

- about placements your school is offering for trainee teachers
- approximate information about placements your school may be able to offer
- your school is not offering placements and does not want to be contacted

Teacher training providers will contact you if they can help place a suitable trainee teacher.

### If you work for a teacher training provider
Find schools that are offering placements for trainee teachers, as well as schools that are considering offering placements but require more information.

View placement contact details for schools so you can email them if you are interested in working together.
