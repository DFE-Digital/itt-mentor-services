As part of DfE’s assurance checks, we may ask for supporting evidence for a claim. This process will start in October 2024, for the academic year 2023 to 24.

Even if we do not ask for evidence now, we advise schools and providers to keep evidence, as DfE may ask for it in the future.

Additional guidance will be published on GOV.UK in September 2024 and will include:

- a recommendation that schools and accredited providers collaborate to confirm the number of training hours for each mentor
- notification at the start of the claim assurance process will go to the provider and not the placement school. DfE will contact the accredited provider to check the number of hours being claimed is accurate. If further evidence is needed, the provider will request it from the placement school.

Our current guidance about types of evidence has not changed.

We may ask the accredited provider to share evidence of:

- the number of hours of training each general mentor received
- the name of the mentor
- the workplace of the mentor

To help accredited providers, the types of evidence schools may need are:

- a mentor’s employment at the school, for example, a copy of their employment contract or payslips from the 2023 to 2024 academic year
- evidence of arranging placements at your school for ITT trainees, such as communication with providers
- number of hours of initial mentor training completed
- details of accredited provider and lead mentor who delivered the training

If you have any questions about providing supporting evidence, please email <a href="mailto:ittmentor.training@education.gov.uk">ittmentor.training<wbr>@education.gov.uk</a>
