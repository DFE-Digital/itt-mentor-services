As the first year of the Claim funding for mentor training service (Claims) closes for the academic year 2023 to 2024, we wanted to share and celebrate the successes and learnings.

Our aim was to design a digital service that is easy to use, accessible and that helps educational organisations claim payment for the time and resources needed to support general mentor training.

We tested the new Claims service with two teacher training (ITT) accredited providers and around 310 schools.

So far, we have:

- Received over 340 claims
- Started processing and validating over Â£380,000 in funding claimed through the service this academic year
- Built in processes for payment and evidence gathering
- Used insights from within the service and through speaking to users, to make design and technical changes that will help them complete their claim

We continue to gather feedback from our users and aim to make improvements to the service ahead of the planned public beta roll-out in spring 2025.

We hope that in 2025, all eligible educational organisations will claim the funding that is available to them.
